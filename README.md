# Mike's Portfolio
Love finding fun ways to visualize data and am always exploring new techniques. <a href="https://linktr.ee/michaelmacdonald25">Here</a> is some of my work with additional details below.

Currently expanding my knowledge of Python and r while settling in to GitHub.

Collaborations always welcome! :)
